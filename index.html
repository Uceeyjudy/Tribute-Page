                    <h3>NAFDAC</h3>
                    She was appointed NAFDAC DG in 2001 and served till 2009.[8]

Akunyili had a special motivation for attacking the country's counterfeit drug problem and 
this is because, in 1988, she had watched her sister aged 21, die after being given injections of 
fake insulin as part of regular diabetes treatment. She put together a team of mostly female
 pharmacists and inspectors and started a war against counterfeit drugs that saw many open-air medicine 
 markets across the country closed down. Including one in Kano State after her officers confiscated 
 Â£140,000 worth of fake drugs. The agency, under her leadership, broadcast jingles on radio and 
 television to make the public aware of the dangers of substandard drugs and to encourage people to 
 report suspicious drugs while also publishing lists of counterfeit products regularly in the newspapers.
<br>
 In July 2003, the International Children's Heart Foundation visited Nigeria to operate on sick children
  at a teaching hospital in Enugu. After four children died in what appeared to be a case of counterfeit 
  medical supplies, and despite being confronted with what seemed to be a hospital cover-up, Akunyili 
  confiscated supplies and found fake adrenalin, fake muscle relaxant and infected intravenous drips.
<br>
As of June 2006, she was reported to have secured convictions for 45 counterfeiters with 56 cases pending
. Her efforts led to increased public awareness about counterfeit drugs and more direct and purposeful 
surveillance at Nigerian customs.
